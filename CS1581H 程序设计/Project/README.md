# Na√Øve Greedy Snake

## Introduction

### Project Content

* A simple and classical game of greedy snake
* The player control a snake walking around to eat food
* Every time the snake eats food it gets a block longer
* If the snake crashes into the wall or hits itself the game ends
* Your score is in direct ratio with the length of the snake

### Function Realization

* Only use the language of C++ under the environment of Visual Studio 2019
* Rely on the graphics library **EasyX**
* Two modules (Construct and Snake) together with main program compose the project
* "Construct" provides basic classes (Coordinate) and math functions
* "Snake" provides class of snake, supporting every operation of the object
* Main program control timing and interaction, based on the class of snake
* Further functions can be easily done (Different game maps and levels), but I do not think they are valuable

### Team Contribution

* Code by myself
* Video by myself
* Report by myself

### Some Complaints

* No normal student would be willing to do this homework
* Such a simple project is not suitable for team work
* C++ (not to mention Qt) is never a good choice for game development
